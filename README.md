## About me

I'm Stewart Millar, software engineering student and currently in situ as a technical intern with Puppet

 


## Things I am passionate about

- Robots, the more human-passable the better
- Guitars, music gear in general and digital-audio processing. Writing and playing music, which was easier before I developed pretty crippling RSI. 
- Aliens (I want to believe))
